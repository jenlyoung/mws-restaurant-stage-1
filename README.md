# Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1

## Overview of the Project

This is the first project in the Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course.  The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a knowledge of responsive web design.

This project focuses on three aspects of responsive web design:

    * Responsive images
    * Accessibility
    * Offline capabilities

### How to Use the Project

1. To run this program, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. If you already have Python installed, check which version you have in a terminal with `python -V`.

3. Once you know the version of Python that you have, spin up the server using Python.
    * If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
    * For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
